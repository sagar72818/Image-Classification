Image Classificaton using Neural Network

Image_classification.ipynb :- 

I have done a model which gives the accuracy of classification of around 10 things like ['airplane','automobile','bird','cat','deer','dog','frog','horse','ship','truck']
In this using the opencv library if we upload the pic of any thing among the list shown above then our model predicts whose image is this along with the accuracy of confidence
of prediction.

I have also attached the google collab link for better implementation of this code :-
